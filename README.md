# Themes directory for third party themes for EdgeTX

*Initial Draft Specification - subject to change!*

A theme for EdgeTX consists of 5 files, all sharing the initial part of the filename:
<ol>
  <li>themefile.yml (where <code>themefile</code> is the name of your theme, and is the same for all files)</li>
  <li>
    themefile.png (a logo/banner for your theme)
    <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeTX/themes/main/example/ETX.png">
  </li>
  <li>
    themefile1.png (first screenshot, of the main screen with some common widgets selected)
    <br><img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX1.png">
  </li>
  <li>
    themefile2.png (second screenshot, of model selection screen with at least two models present)  
    <br><img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX2.png">

  <li>
    themefile3.png (third screenshot, of the channel monitor)  
    <br><img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX3.png">
  </li>
</ol>

Images should all be in PNG format, and 225 x 128 pixels in size.
