# themes
Themes directory for third party themes for EdgeTX

*Initial Draft Specification - subject to change!*

The required layout for themes to be listed in the directory will be:
- themefile.yml (where `themefile` is the name of your theme, and is the same for all files)
- themefile.png (a logo/banner for your theme)
- themefile1.png (first screenshot, of the main screen with some common widgets selected)
- themefile2.png (second screenshot, of model selection screen with at least two models present)
- themefile3.png (third screenshot, of the channel monitor)

Images should all be in PNG format, and 225 x 128 pixels in size.

Please refer to the `example` folder for an example of the expected layout.

Please refer to TODO documentation for more information on the theme file format.
