# themes
Themes directory for third party themes for EdgeTX

*Initial Draft Specification - subject to change!*

The required layout for themes to be listed in the directory will be:
- themefile.yml (where `themefile` is the name of your theme, and is the same for all files)  
- themefile.png (a logo/banner for your theme)  
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeTX/themes/main/example/ETX.png">
- themefile1.png (first screenshot, of the main screen with some common widgets selected)  
  <img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX1.png">  
- themefile2.png (second screenshot, of model selection screen with at least two models present)  
  <img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX2.png">  
- themefile3.png (third screenshot, of the channel monitor)  
  <img src="https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/main/example/ETX3.png">  

Images should all be in PNG format, and 225 x 128 pixels in size.

Please refer to the `example` folder for an example of the expected layout.

Please refer to TODO documentation for more information on the theme file format.
